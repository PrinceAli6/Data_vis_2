New title,
New colours (Distinguish males and females a bit better),
New map projection (mercator is better here because we needed to perserve angles),
Different strokes as well (the old ones took away from what we needed to see),
Also improved the tool tip by specifying which gendder it is (i.e makes it easier for squished data points like in Europe).
