            Suicide is a prevelant issue within our society today. 
            The proportional symbol plot on the left shows the number
            of suicides per 100k men and women in each country 
            (that the world health organisation had data on. Countries like China did not provide data hence are empty).
            One trend that remains obvious is that east Asia and eastern Europe
            tends to have higher rates per 100k men and women compared to the rest of the world. South Korea having the largest number of suicides in east Asia 
            for males at 40 per 100k and Lithuania having the highest suicides for Males at 57 per 100k. For females we see that in
            east Asia once again South Korea is leading, females commit suicide at a rate of 16 per 100k. In eastern Europe once again
            Lithuania leads in female suicides again at a rate of 11 per 100k. 
            It also appears that overall, Men appear to disportionately be committing suicide at a higher rate than women.

                Something that is very commonly connected to the suicide rate of countries is the 
                happiness index of that country. A happiness index is a formal measure of the "happiness" within a country
                as a function of several factors (politcal,social,environmental,etc) the largest factor is often thought to be how wealthy that country is.
                Looking at the scatterplot on the left hand side it is obvious to see the linear trend that as countries are more and more richer (as measured by GDP) per capita
                the happier that country tends to be.

        <p class="Main_text"> With the suicides of each country it is often also necessary to understand the situation in the broader context.
            One of these contexts is time. On the left is a stacked line chart from 1981 to 2015 that shows the suicide rate of men and women per 100k (filter at bottom).
        The countries in particular that we're looking at are Australia as a baseline from where I live, Finland which is the happiest country in the world, Lithuania which had
        the highest suicide rates in eastern Europe, and lastly South Korea which had the largest suicide rate in east Asia. What's really striking about this line chart is that for Males
        the suicide rate per 100k has been decreasing steadily across all the countries except for Australia where it has remained stagnant and South Korea where it has actually
        been increasing steadily.<br>
        For Women this is largely the same except that for South Korea after 2009 we see a decreasing trend and for Australia alarmingly we see that
        after 2010 we see that there is an increasing trend in suicide rates among women! </p>
